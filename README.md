Whether you're crafting epic 3D games or 2D adventures, DionENG’s got you covered with a robust ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture, ray tracing, dynamic resolution, and more. Let’s build something awesome together!

# Features

# ECS Architecture: Flexible entity management with components like Transform, MeshRenderer, and TacticalAI.
# Rendering: Supports 2D/3D rendering with OpenGL (moderngl) and ray tracing.
# Physics: 2D and 3D physics systems for realistic collisions.
# AI and Networking: Tactical AI and multiplayer support.
# Performance: Optimized with JobSystem for parallel processing and Profiler for metrics.
# Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
# Demos: Try examples/demo_scene_1/ for a taste of what DionENG can do!
